    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;re building an iOS app, and need the user to enter a money value. You start by using
a UITextField. If you want a basic user experience, then you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>If you want to give the user <em>something better</em>, then the pain begins. The pain is worth
it because <strong>small details matter</strong>. I&rsquo;ve taken ideas from a few places &amp; combined them
into this experience &amp; open source code.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Experience in 9 images</h2>

<p>1. We start &amp; sit there, begging the user to enter something. We&rsquo;re showing $0.00, so we have
sent a signal to them that they are entering a money value. The cursor is flashing at them
after the last 0 at the end of the formatted money value.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/1.png" width="396" height="744" title="Start, Shows $0.00" ></p>

<p>2. The user taps the 1 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $0.01</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/2.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 1, Changes to $0.01" ></p>

<p>3. The user taps the 2 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $0.12</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/3.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 2, Changes to $0.12" ></p>

<p>4. The user taps the 3 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $1.23</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t had to enter in a dot. They are just tapping numbers, and the displayed
money value is formatting itself in front of their eyes.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/4.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 3, Changes to $1.23" ></p>

<p>5. The user taps some more numbers &ndash; 4, 5, and then 6. The display value changes to $1,234.56</p>

<p>We have a comma! The money value is formatted.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/5.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 4, 5, 6, Changes to $1,234.56" ></p>

<p>6. The user taps Delete. The display value changes to $123.45</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/6.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap Delete, Deletes 6" ></p>

<p>7. The user moves the cursor to after 1, taps Delete. The display value changes to $23.45</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/7.png" width="396" height="744" title="Move cursor to after 1, and Tap Delete, Deletes 1" ></p>

<p>8. From start the user gets ready to paste in &lsquo;$1,000&rsquo; (without quotes) from somewhere else.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/8.png" width="396" height="744" title="From Start, Get ready to Paste $1,000" ></p>

<p>9. The &lsquo;$1,000&rsquo; gets pasted in &amp; the display value changes to $1,000.00.</p>

<p>Note that the display value didn&rsquo;t change to $10.00, which would have happened if we
didn&rsquo;t trap the paste and format the value before updating the display value.</p>

<p>Also note that the user could also paste in &lsquo;1000&rsquo; or &lsquo;$1000&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/9.png" width="396" height="744" title="Paste in $1,000, Changes to $1,000.00" ></p>

    <link href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/29/ios-7-dynamic-type/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-29T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/29/ios-7-dynamic-type</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iOS 7 introduces Dynamic Type, which if apps choose to support it, gives the user
control over text size in an app. Web pages have had this feature for free since the early
days of the web, but web browsers moved away from dynamic text sizing.
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/the-two-types-of-browser-zoom.html">The Two Types of Browser Zoom</a>.</p>

<p>iOS7 Dynamic Type automatically adjusts weight, letter spacing, and line height for every font
size. It looks <strong>stunning</strong>, but there&rsquo;s work to make your app support it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Default Size</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/">UserXListView</a> looks like with the Text Size
(Settings &ndash; General &ndash; Text Size) set to the default size in the <em>iPhone Retina (3.5-inch)</em>
iOS Simulator.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/1-text-size-normal.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Default" ></p>

<p>We get 3 &amp; &lsquo;a bit&rsquo; cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/2-UserXListView-normal.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Default" ></p>

<h2>Smallest Size</h2>

<p>Changing the Text Size to the smallest size means we can fit slightly more.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/3-text-size-small.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Smallest" ></p>

<p>Nearly 4 cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/4-UserXListView-small.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Smallest" ></p>

<h2>Largest Size</h2>

<p>Changing the Text Size to the largest size means we can fit slightly less, but get big
beautiful type.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/5-text-size-large.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Largest" ></p>

<p>3 cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/6-UserXListView-large.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Largest" ></p>

<h2>Implementation, The Easy Part</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it looks, but how hard is it to make your app support it. Let&rsquo;s look at
<a href="/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/">UserXListView</a>. The cell layout makes use of Auto
Layout Constraints, which are very powerful.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/7-UserXListView-cell-layout.png" width="381" height="674" title="UserXListView Cell Layout" ></p>

<p>iOS 7 has defined Text Styles &ndash; Body, Caption 1, Caption 2, Footnote, Headline 1,
Headline 2, Subhead 1, and Subhead 2. We assign a Text Style to each label in the cell
layout via the attribute inspector as shown below.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/8-UserXListView-cell-label-attribute-inspector.png" width="316" height="196" title="UserXListView Cell Label Attribute Inspector" ></p>

<p>Once the label Text Styles &amp; Auto Layout Constraints are set, we&rsquo;re ready for the hard
part.</p>

<h2>Implementation, The Hard Part</h2>

<p>Unlike Auto Layout in this example, there&rsquo;s more work to do to support
Dynamic Type.</p>

<p>We need to make the Controller aware of a Text Size change by hooking into the
UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. iOS 7 determines &amp; applies the font attributes for each label based on the
Text Style for each label, and the iOS 7 Text Size system setting selected by the user,
and it&rsquo;s left to us (the developer) to cater for the changes in the layout to the view.</p>

<p>As you can see there&rsquo;s a bit of extra work to support Dynamic Type. It would be nice if
it was a bit smarter, a bit more automatic, but with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <link href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-24T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I believe the best way to understand something is to get your hands dirty, so I decided
to build the front end part of an app idea that I&rsquo;ve had for a while as an iOS 7 app.</p>

<p>While using iOS 7 for the last week or so, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the UI &amp; UX.
Of course, Metro (design language) has been around for a while thanks to Microsoft, but
the Metro apps I&rsquo;ve used feel dull. iOS 7 feels surprisingly refreshing.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One of the views in the app I&rsquo;m building needs a list of <em>things</em> that the user creates &ndash;
a typical pattern in many apps. iOS has a UITableViewController, so technically it&rsquo;s an
easy problem to solve. In terms of the design of the UI &amp; UX it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through what I call the UserXListView&trade; pattern in 7 images of the
iOS 7 app I&rsquo;ve started building.</p>

<h2>1. Empty List View</h2>

<p>Ok. We have a list view. That + in the top right corner is staring at her.
Tap me! Tap me!</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-1-list-view.png" width="396" height="744" title="1. Empty List View" ></p>

<h2>2. Add Item (with default Icon &amp; Colour)</h2>

<p>She taps +. She knows that she&rsquo;s going to create something. What&rsquo;s the first
decision? What to name it? No. The first decision is an emotional one. What&rsquo;s this thing
going to look like.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-2-add-item.png" width="396" height="744" title="2. Add Item (with default Icon &amp; Colour)" ></p>

<p>Technically this is a modal segue; either Cancel and go back, or enter the required
information &amp; Save.</p>

<h2>3. Item Icon</h2>

<p>She taps Change Icon. This is where it gets interesting. The icons are in groups &amp; are
all black so that they are easy for her to judge equally. In this instance there&rsquo;s only one
group of simple icons from The Noun Project, that are visually related to the thing that
she is creating.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-3-icons.png" width="396" height="744" title="3. Item Icon" ></p>

<p>Once again this is a modal segue; either Cancel and go back, or give the required
information, which in this instance is selecting an icon. We use a UICollectionViewController
that&rsquo;s dynamic. We define the icon groups &amp; icons as follows.</p>

<h2>4. Item Icon Colour</h2>

<p>She taps the piggy bank icon (they&rsquo;re cute). Now she can personalise the icon even further
by selecting a colour from different groups of colour palettes. She can select a colour
from the same palette to match all her <em>things</em>, or mix &amp; match colours from different
colour palettes. The choice is hers. If she doesn&rsquo;t like the icon in any of these colours
she can either tap &lt; Icon, or as a nice feature of iOS 7, swipe left to right inside where
the icons are located and the view will slide off the top to the right and she will be taken
back to the black icons.</p>

<p>This time we do a push segue. We use a UICollectionViewController that&rsquo;s dynamic, and some
Core Graphics help. In the app we only store one black piggy bank icon .png file, and at
runtime dynamically colour each piggy bank. We define the colour groups &amp; colours as follows.</p>

<h2>5. Add Item (with selected Icon &amp; Colour)</h2>

<p>She taps the red piggy bank in the Ocean Five colour group, and is taken back to the
2. Add Item view, with her red piggy bank there waiting for her. She can now enter the
other information and tap Save.</p>

<h2>6. Item in List View</h2>

<p>She taps Save, and her new red piggy bank is waiting for her in the list view. All that&rsquo;s
left to do is to add some more.</p>

<h2>7. List View with Items</h2>

<p>As she looks at the list of her <em>things</em>, she instantly recognises &amp; associates with each
one, as it has her personal identifying touch.</p>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s easy to give the user power over their <em>things</em> by a simple mobile
UI &amp; UX pattern, hereby called the UserXListView&trade; pattern.</p>

<h2>Storyboard</h2>

<p>For reference here&rsquo;s how the views hang together in the Storyboard. Excluding the
UINavigationControlers we have a UITableViewController, UIViewController, and
two UICollectionViewControllers.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-03T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/04/03/app-dev-is-not-rapid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Application Development is not Rapid. There, I finally typed it. It feels like a weight off my fingers. I have been creating applications for over 20 years, and do a damn good job of it. I&rsquo;m not arrogant, there are many developers that are smarter, more creative, or more productive. If I was to describe myself as a developer in one word I&rsquo;d say simple, which is kind of funny, because fear of being labelled that has stopped me writing this in the past. This is a post based on my thoughts &amp; feelings at the state of application development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I have written before about why I <a href="/blog/2013/02/24/creating-software/">create software</a>, and my struggle with software development complexity. I&rsquo;m going to tell a story about my experience with the Technology, and it&rsquo;s contribution to the People, Process &amp; Technology triad when building applications.</p>

<p>My first job out of university was doing Microsoft Access &lsquo;database&rsquo; development for a large mining company. I put database in quotes because I didn&rsquo;t think of Access as strictly a database at the time. We built tables with constraints &amp; relationships, queries, forms, reports, and logic (macros &amp; VBA). Mostly via point &amp; click, and writing simple code. We built applications. It was and still is amazing to me how much two Access developers built, with one of them being so naive &amp; inexperienced.</p>

<p>I then progressed to building a web application, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ColdFusion (version 4.0 from 1999) &amp; SQL Server. There&rsquo;s a few more technologies there than my Microsoft Access experience, but ColdFusion rocked. It joined the other technologies together seamlessly, and it made creating an application rapid. I felt productive.</p>

<blockquote><p>To me rapid development meant quickly building working application software that fulfilled a need with simple, powerful tools. It meant building &amp; joining together the parts in an easily learned, understood, and consistent way that supported change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where did I find myself after a few experiences of rapid application development? I found myself in the distinctly non-rapid world of enterprise systems development. There was titanic Sun, IBM, Oracle &amp; Microsoft technologies. I found myself submerged in Sun Java, J2SE, J2EE, IBM WebSphere, Oracle Database, and Microsoft .NET &amp; Servers. Within each one I used a dizzying array of technologies &ndash; to use an abstract term to describe the things you could use &amp; the ways you could use them. There were plenty of acronyms that made you feel accomplished if you knew what they stood for, even if you didn&rsquo;t know what they did.</p>

<p>My view of web application architecture had exploded from a few technologies to many, many layers of them. ColdFusion was replaced by an astoundingly complex maze of choices. Want to display a database field on the screen? Oh, not so quick Mr Simple Developer. We need to do it in a modern, best practice, scalable way. I did not feel productive.</p>

<p>This is where some people would stop me in my story, call me a non-believer, and then begin to preach the virtues of their given religion. I have no desire to go into any of them here. All I will say is that I&rsquo;ve seen people wield them as weapons, instead of collaborating with people to use them. The criteria I evaluate technology by is pretty simple. Can I understand it? Does it make sense in my gut? This may seem like a simpletons view, but it&rsquo;s proven correct time &amp; again. Is it simple to understand &amp; work with quickly? How many layers of abstraction or indirection are there? What value do they add? Is there a simpler way to do it? Would other people understand what it&rsquo;s doing? How about in 5 years? Is it closed, open, popular? What does it feel like to use?</p>

<p>Microsoft Access &amp; ColdFusion still exist 13 years after I used them. Access 2013 looks like it&rsquo;s been given new Metro (sorry, Windows 8-style UI) &amp; web coats, but underneath it looks like the same animal that has not evolved in over a decade. There are rapid application development platforms &amp; tools out there, but why haven&rsquo;t they evolved, and become more widely used for application development? particularly enterprise systems development?</p>

    <updated>2013-02-24T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/02/24/creating-software</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi my name is Peter and I&rsquo;m a developer, now playing an architect, and still trying to figure out what that means. But that&rsquo;s a post for another day. Probably many posts.</p>

<p>To put this post in context my background is mostly &lsquo;front end&rsquo; software development in DOS, Windows, Web, and Mobile; mostly with software that has a user interface, but occasionally not.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Complexity</h2>

<p>I have always struggled with software development complexity.</p>

<p>I love software development. Communicating &amp; collaborating with people and computers, thinking, planning, modelling, designing, delving into my creative mind &amp; soul, engineering and <em>crafting</em> software that fulfils a need, creating is … awesome!</p>

<p>Software development is complex, but I believe <em>we make it more complex</em>. In our quest to make software development better, we lose focus, and we end up creating complexity.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Complexity can exist at many different steps in the software development journey. What do you do with something that&rsquo;s complex? You create a process to perform it of course.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most infamous process is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The waterfall model is a sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds great doesn&rsquo;t it? Follow a detailed plan, err &hellip; &lsquo;phases in a waterfall&rsquo;, and you will have software at the end of the process that fulfils your need. People have been following it for <em>decades</em>. There&rsquo;s only one problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The first formal description of the waterfall model is often cited as a 1970 article by Winston W. Royce, although Royce did not use the term &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; in this article. Royce presented this model as an example of a flawed, non-working model.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>But this didn&rsquo;t stop people from using it. <em>Still hasn&rsquo;t.</em> Perhaps there is perceived safety in process. If you follow instructions, surely you will achieve the desired end result?</p>

<p>On my first agile project we delivered a green fields software system in 8 months, which would have taken <em>years</em> using our traditional software development process, and this included learning an agile process, tools &amp; techniques. After the project ended I returned to one of the traditional software development areas. Two things struck me like physical blows, and left me with a feeling of complete loss &amp; bewilderment.</p>

<p>The first was that email was my process again. I sent more emails in that first day than in the previous 8 months. The second thing was when I was sitting in my little cubicle, nicely partitioned, I overheard a conversation between two developers &ndash; &ldquo;Reject defect #537. That&rsquo;s not a defect because&hellip;&rdquo; I forget the specifics, but remember that it was two developers, an absurd defect number, and they literally talked about it for 10 &ndash; 15 minutes. It never occurred to them that they should go find the tester &amp; <em>talk</em> to them.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>Processes can be complex, and so can the dizzying universe of technology which is created &amp; wielded by people.</p>

<p>Programming languages are used to build software, and there are thousands of them, with more being created every year. Each one has it&rsquo;s own syntax (form) and semantics (meaning) for expressing it&rsquo;s instructions to a machine.</p>

<p>There are different types of software. For example operating systems manage hardware and provide services for other software. Platforms, frameworks, libraries, and applications use operating systems, and each other.</p>

<p>Each piece of software can be complex, and working software can be a complex web of relationships between them. Just how complex can be highlighted by a seemingly absurd comparison.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For decades computer scientists have strived to build machines that can calculate faster than the human brain and store more information. The contraptions have won. &hellip; Biology does a lot with a little: the human genome, which grows our body and directs us through years of complex life, requires less data than a laptop operating system.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It takes time to understand technology, when to use it, and how to apply it, and people often come away with different understanding, and a different level of skill in using it.</p>

<p>Early in my career I was working on a project when it was decided a well known services company (name withheld) would come in, save the day, and show us how to do it properly. There was one <em>recognised expert</em> I will always remember. He sat quietly aloof at his desk every day, apart from the occasional very important closed door meeting. Each day he would take from his desk a book from the vast array of &lsquo;software development&rsquo; books on it (his personal collection), sit there with it in front of his computer and implement some new form of <em>best practice</em> code or <em>pattern</em> for the part of the project he was working on. He was seen as highly productive.</p>

<p>When he left his masterpiece was given to me, with no hand over. You can guess the outcome. It was either the most brilliant code I have ever seen in my entire life, and I was unworthy to begin to comprehend it&rsquo;s magnificence, or it was a pile of shit. The truth was probably somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>The sad thing is I&rsquo;ve seen this behaviour to varying degrees <em>consistently</em> over the years. It&rsquo;s something I have been guilty of as well. People wielding technology, rather than collaborating with people using technology.</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>When I think about software development I think about the following words in a positive, <em>great</em> context.</p>

<p>People.<br/>
Purpose.<br/>
Knowledge.<br/>
Capability.<br/>
Humility.<br/>
Communication.<br/>
Collaboration.<br/>
Compromise.<br/>
Consistency.<br/>
Passion.<br/>
Time.<br/>
Technology.<br/>
Simplicity.</p>

<p>I put people first. They are the enduring <em>thread</em> that ties man to machine, and getting it to do what they want. Process &amp; Technology seem to forget that sometimes.</p>

<p>I put technology second last. Without everything before it, it is useless.</p>

<p>I put simplicity last. I believe it will <em>emerge</em> if you have the rest.</p>

<p>If only we had all of these things, all of the time.</p>

<p>You can create software without some of these things, but not <em>great</em> software.</p>
