    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Update: PhotoArchive now has a permanent home.
For the latest information visit <a href="/photoarchive">PhotoArchive for iPhone</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I take a lot of photos &amp; videos with my iPhone.
It&rsquo;s always with me, so it&rsquo;s convenient, and the quality is good.
My DSLR body &amp; lenses produce superior quality, but are usually left at home gathering dust.</p>

<p>When I take new photos or videos, often of my family, I worry that if something were to happen to my iPhone, those irreplaceable memories will be lost forever.</p>

<p>There are many solutions for this need, for example iCloud Backup, the Dropbox app, or the Amazon Cloud Drive app, but they all have varying costs &amp; limitations.
I wanted a simple solution for me, and that&rsquo;s why I decided to build an app as a side project &ndash; PhotoArchive for iPhone.
When released, PhotoArchive will be free for everyone on the App Store.</p>

<h2>What it looks like</h2>

<div align="center">
<img src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2014-02-15-photoarchive/black.png" style="border:none !important;">
<img src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2014-02-15-photoarchive/white.png" style="border:none !important;">
</div>


<p></p>


<h2>What it does</h2>

<p>I have a Western Digital My Book NAS (Network Attached Storage) at home that is always on.
I use it for file storage for computers on the network, and DLNA streaming to the living room TV via the PS3.</p>

<p>I copy new photos &amp; videos from my &amp; my wife&rsquo;s iPhones by manually connecting them to a computer via USB, and downloading the new ones.
Because it&rsquo;s a tedious manual process I don&rsquo;t do it as often as I should.</p>

<p>What PhotoArchive does is copy new photos &amp; videos from your iOS device to an FTP server, over Wi-Fi.
The Western Digital My Book NAS, like most NAS, supports FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</p>

<p>This means that when I get home I can effortlessly back up new photos &amp; videos I&rsquo;ve taken that day &ndash; no turning on computers, no USB cables etc.</p>

<h2>What it does (marketing version)</h2>

<p>What does PhotoArchive do?</p>

<blockquote><p>PhotoArchive saves your irreplaceable memories, your photos &amp; videos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your home storage over Wi-Fi.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Save Time</strong> &ndash; Stop manually backing up your device to iTunes. Are you still using a USB cable? Stop manually backing up your photos &amp; videos by importing them into iPhoto. You may still import them into iPhoto, but you can do it when you have time, not when you have to &ndash; your photos &amp; videos are already safe!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Save Money</strong> &ndash; Use iCloud Backup to back up everything except your Camera Roll, so there is no need to manually back up your device to iTunes. Turn off the Camera Roll from iCloud Backup, and stay under the 5.0 GB free limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Archives</strong> &ndash; Does not synchronise. Will not download photos or videos from your home storage to your device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Never Deletes</strong> &ndash; Will never delete a photo or video from your home storage, or from your device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smart Archive</strong> &ndash; Remembers the previous archive, and will only upload new photos &amp; videos, so it&rsquo;s <em>FAST</em>!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smart Photo View</strong> &ndash; Shows you your photos &amp; videos that are in danger of being lost forever (not archived), and the ones that are safe in the event that something happens to your device (archived).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full Resolution &amp; Metadata</strong> &ndash; Uploads your photos &amp; videos in their full resolution, with all metadata &ndash; information about your photos &amp; videos, e.g. where you took them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>How does PhotoArchive work?</p>

<p>PhotoArchive archives to your home storage &ndash; NAS (Network Attached Storage) or Mac/PC, using FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Most NAS devices already support FTP, but if you are using a Mac/PC you will need an FTP server.</p>

<p>FTP should only be used on Wi-Fi with WPA2 security, with your storage on the same network. Don&rsquo;t do it over the Internet! Be security smart.</p>

<h2>Design thinking</h2>

<p>The main view that greets the user visually shows them all photos &amp; videos on their iOS device, grouped into state &ndash; not archived, or archived.
It first shows photos &amp; videos that are not archived (in danger of being lost forever), and then photos &amp; videos that are archived (safe).</p>

<p>The user can either setup their archive destination, or start archiving if already setup &amp; there are new photos or videos.</p>

<p>I took inspiration from the iOS Photos app, and show photos &amp; videos as varying square sizes.</p>

<p>The Not Archived section photos &amp; videos are shown as large squares up to a certain number, and then get smaller.
Large squares let you see the few photos &amp; videos that you haven&rsquo;t archived up close.
If there&rsquo;s lots, then they are shown as small squares to give you a visual sense of how many there are.
The section header is the PhotoArchive logo on red &ndash; danger!</p>

<p>The Archived section shows photos &amp; videos as small squares; they are safe, so you don&rsquo;t need to see what they are, just get a visual sense of how many there are.
The section header is the PhotoArchive logo on blue (this is the app icon) &ndash; safe.</p>

<p>The design allows both sections to appear together on the main view without much scrolling required.</p>

<h2>When will it be released</h2>

<p>PhotoArchive is functionally complete.
I&rsquo;m currently cleaning, polishing &amp; testing it.
It would be great to have a few testers, so if you&rsquo;d like to test it out &amp; are willing to provide feedback, then contact me at <a href="peter.boni@gmail.com">peter.boni@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>Since the purpose of PhotoArchive is to save your irreplaceable memories, i&rsquo;ve thought about adding support for offsite archiving to cloud storage such as Amazon S3 or Glacier.</p>

<p>Amazon Glacier is attractive because of it&rsquo;s extreme lost cost &ndash; USD$0.01 per GB (gigabyte) per month.
That&rsquo;s just over USD$10 per month to archive 1TB (terabyte) of photos &amp; videos!</p>

    <updated>2013-01-01T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/01/01/failmeaningfully</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was August 2010. Over 2 years ago. My beautiful daughter Abigail was 2 years old. The iPhone 4 had just come out, and the smartphone revolution was in full swing. All I needed was an idea. Somehow I found myself become part of a like minded, passionate &amp; committed team, with some of the best people I have ever had the privilege or pleasure to work with. I say somehow because I&rsquo;ve always tried to go with the flow. It just happened. Redistore was born.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/website.png" width="569" height="635" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<!--more-->


<p>The idea &amp; vision was simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if you could order &amp; pay for your coffee <em>before</em> you arrived at the store, just waltz in, bypass the queue, pick it up &amp; go. It&rsquo;s paid for so there&rsquo;s no fumbling around for change, or paying with a card which was time consuming before contactless payment, e.g. MasterCard PayPass. I thought the idea had potential. The team thought the idea had potential. People we talked to thought the idea had potential. We decided as a team to take a risk. &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams">If you build it, he will come</a>&rsquo;, we all heard the voice whisper. Others were skeptical, but not us. We built it.</p>

<p>2 years later, and Redistore has failed. This is what I learnt.</p>

<h2>Reality</h2>

<p>I can still remember how it started. The excitement of exploring the idea. Formulating it. Talking about it. Becoming a team. It felt awesome. That&rsquo;s the Hollywood beginning.</p>

<p>The reality was a hard slog of trying to work two jobs. 15 to 16 hour days, 5 to 6 days a week. Rise at 6am, cycle to work &amp; be working by 7am. Leave at 4pm. Be home &amp; sorted by 5pm. Two hours to spend with my family, which I&rsquo;m guilty of not doing enough of. At work by 7pm. Work till 9pm or 10pm. Rinse &amp; repeat. And don&rsquo;t forget the weekends. You get the picture. I had no life.</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>

<p><em>But</em> we built something that&rsquo;s bloody cool &amp; has possibility. A fully customisable, real time online ordering system for low value, high volume consumables. Coffee stores. Take away food. The order is paid for by the customer using their Redistore account which they can &lsquo;top up&rsquo; using PayPal or a Credit Card. The store gets a verified order. It&rsquo;s in real time. There&rsquo;s no queueing. Win win.</p>

<p>The technology &amp; platform that we built was the fun part.</p>

<p>The customer web client was built using Sencha ExtJS 3 and supports all major browsers. It was designed &amp; built from scratch to provide a <em>fast</em> UX (User Experience) for browsing stores &amp; ordering, unlike most classic page request &amp; response web stores. ExtJS is an amazing platform, but has a steep learning curve, and ExtJS 4 broke compatibility for ExtJS 3 apps; there is significant work required to upgrade your app.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient1.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient2.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient3.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p>The now defunct customer mobile client was built using Sencha Touch 1. The native vs. web app mobile holy war was raging, and we decided to build a web app. It was a mistake. The mobile client worked adequately on iOS, but on Android it was unusable. The tools were not ready. Facebook had not yet <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">admitted their mistake</a>, nor Sencha fired their <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story/">Fastbook</a> return. We needed a <em>great</em> customer UX, and didn&rsquo;t have it.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox left" src="/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/iphone-app.png" width="320" height="548" title="Redistore iPhone App" ></p>

<p>The store receiver client was also built with Sencha Touch, and performs adequately for stores on an iPod.</p>

<p>The web clients communicate via Ajax to the back end action style JSON based web services developed using .NET WCF. If building using the same core technology now, we&rsquo;d seriously look at Web API &amp; RESTful services. There&rsquo;s also a ton of awesome back-end enterprise system type stuff (database, reconciliation, reporting, MI etc.), that was built by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_(Battlestar_Galactica)">Cylon</a>. Seriously. They work <em>hard</em>, I guess because they don&rsquo;t need to sleep.</p>

<p>To address the <em>great</em> customer mobile UX, after go-live we spent 3 months building a native iPhone app, and 3 months building a native Android app. It was a great learning experience at the cost of 6 months of effort. Without getting into details of our approach, or religious debates, I hope that we (the industry) can move <strong>forward</strong> to <em>the web</em>. How we do that is for <a href="http://www.okito.net/post/38255553240/the-mobile-web">smart people</a> to <a href="http://lilly.tumblr.com/post/38309067913/asymmetry">work out</a>.</p>

<h2>Go Live</h2>

<p>We went live on Friday 1st April 2011 (oh the irony) after 8 months of intense development. There were teething problems as with any new production system, and we worked through them to get it to a stable state.</p>

<p>We tried to sell it mostly to coffee stores the old fashioned way, by approaching them, talking to them about it, showing them what it could do. Once we had a store on board we did really simple customer advertising at the store.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s <em>far</em> from being a runaway success, it has &amp; continues to be <em>successful</em>, in that it ticks along &amp; is used every single business day, with no issues.</p>

<p>Over 18 months in production, what are the stats?</p>

<ul>
<li>250 accounts. 43 active in November 2012. 68 with a balance > $5.</li>
<li>5 stores. 2 active.</li>
<li>4,712 orders (multiple items per order). 63% using web. 36% using mobile.</li>
<li>1,900 top ups (min $5 per top up).</li>
</ul>


<p>The order percentages between web &amp; mobile are interesting. The 2 active stores are located in office buildings, and it implies customers prefer using the web client to order from their desks, before going down to pickup their order.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>The enthusiasm &amp; commitment for the idea &amp; vision has dispersed. What it could have been didn&rsquo;t materialise, and not by lack of effort.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we really understood our customer, as we really just replaced phone orders. We didn&rsquo;t have an automated store onboarding process, so bringing stores on was a long complicated process. We didn&rsquo;t do marketing.</p>

<p>We took a gamble, and it didn&rsquo;t pay off. We failed.</p>

<h2>End</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to move on. To take what I&rsquo;ve learnt &amp; move forward. I&rsquo;m excited about seeking new ideas &amp; projects. Exploring. Finding. Trying. I love the process of creating things. I&rsquo;ve heard the expression &lsquo;<strong>fail fast</strong>&rsquo;, but I think you should &lsquo;<strong>fail meaningfully</strong>&rsquo; at something you choose, have <a href="http://www.zurb.com/article/1131/passion-to-fail-fast">passion</a>
 for, believe in, and work hard at. Learning takes quality time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to move on … <em>after</em> I finish reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com">The Lean Startup</a> by Eric Ries.</p>

<h2>Update: September 22, 2013</h2>

<p>PayPal released their updated app for iOS, version 5.0.1 on <strong>September 5, 2013</strong>.
It&rsquo;s shown below next to Redistore for iOS, which introduced store distance features in version 1.3 released on <strong>April 23, 2012</strong>. Looks like there is some similarity.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-01T16:05:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2012/09/01/demon-hacker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 1995 (17 years ago) I created an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>
app called Demon Hacker.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s purpose was to enable a user to patch (rather crudely, but effectively)
PC games files &amp; their created saved game files to cheat.</p>

<p>I got more of a kick out of building the app using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a>, and giving it to my friends
to use than I did playing &amp; cheating in the games.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>17 years is a <em>long</em> time in computer technology. In 1995 the Internet was emerging, and
I knew that it had been put on a few FTP sites, but could I find it now?</p>

<p>After a few minutes with Google I had found &amp; downloaded the ZIP file.
(And made sure to scan it with antivirus software).</p>

<p><em>Wow!</em></p>

<p>The problem now was that it was a 16-bit MS-DOS app.</p>

<p>With only Mac OS X Mountain Lion, and Windows 7, both 64-bit, I thought I would have
to resort to setting up a VM (Virtual Machine).</p>

<p>Another Google and I found <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox</a>.
I download &amp; opened DOSBox on Mac OS X.</p>

<p><em>Double wow!</em></p>

<p>I now had a directory listing. Look at those dates!</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/dir.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>Check out DEMON.EXE. That&rsquo;s 29,408 bytes for the main application.
UI (User Interface).
Logic.
Everything.
That&rsquo;s 29 kilobytes (KB).</p>

<p><em>Holy crap!</em></p>

<p>Next step, would it run?</p>

<p><em>BOOM!</em></p>

<p>An app that I had created 17 years ago was running in a DOS emulator on my
MAC OS X system.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the proof &ndash; the help screen. You have to admit, it&rsquo;s very helpful :)</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run-help.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>It even supports in that 29 KB size changing the application font to a medieval
type font. Typical font files are MB these days.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run-font.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>The great thing about Demon Hacker is that it was open.
Extendable.
Anyone with a PC game, a HEX editor, and some spare time could create hacks
for games by editing the DEMON.DAT text file.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>20025,64
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And Demon Hacker would then let anyone use that cheat.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/hack.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>If only GitHub had existed back in 1995 the source code may not have been lost.
If you&rsquo;re feeling nostalgic get DOSBox, your old games, and get
<a href="http://www.github.com/peterboni/demonhacker">Demon Hacker</a>.</p>

<p>This trip back down memory lane has reminded me of a few things.
The Internet, WWW, Google &amp; technology are amazing things.
Also that i&rsquo;m a hacker, and always will be.</p>
