    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Liam ran, his long muscular legs pounding the pavement. There were only a few souls out that chose to brave the cold &amp; darkness of the early morning. His breathing &amp; rhythm were steady. He wasn&rsquo;t pushing himself as he settled into his run. He ran to relax &amp; be with his thoughts.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>&ldquo;Show dad running&rdquo; he said softly to himself between breaths. Ahead of him on the long bridge his dad appeared running. He smiled to himself. The music he was listening to changed to a different track. &ldquo;Sweet Dreams, Ministry of Sound Running Trax Winter 2011&rdquo; appeared at the top of his vision, next to more text â€¦ &ldquo;Pace 5:27/km, 20sec slower/km&rdquo;. Memories of his childhood came flooding back of them running together at the park near their home, him desperately trying to keep up with his shorter legs. Better catch the old man now he thought, I&rsquo;m slacking off! He gained on his dad and was finally running in sync with him, side by side.</p>

<p>The nanotechnology in his body connected him to the vast services &amp; data available on the net and seamlessly augmented his reality, which in this case was his vision &amp; hearing. His dad had been born into a time when the world was starting to emerge from their pre-digital caves, and people started leaving digital footprints everywhere they went. He was benefiting from his dads digital footprint now. His dad loved to run, and had recorded them for his own benefit using the primitive tracking technology &amp; services of the time.</p>

<p>This was the first time Liam had been to this city. His dad had been here before &amp; run this same route. As he ran side by side with his dad, listening to the same music he had listened to many years before he felt connected to him, in a way that would not have been possible for his dad&rsquo;s generation. This was his dad, in his prime, doing something that he now loved too, and they were doing it together at different places in time.</p>

<p>As he stopped at the end of the road &amp; looked out over the water, the sight of the Sydney Opera House greeted him. They both stood there, looking at the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge to the right. He turned his head &amp; looked at the avatar of his dad, and smiled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He sat on the bus in the pre-dawn light. Fog partially covered the windows. The inside of the bus felt enclosed in a safe bubble type of way with other silent, faceless souls, the backs of their heads illuminated by the smartphones their heads were buried in.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The brief hint of a smile, or maybe sadness touched his face as he thought of the irony, people connected to the world, but isolated from others in their own bubbles. Lights flashed past the windows as the bus ambled along.</p>

<p>As if in a dream, he slowly turned his head and looked out the window. In awe, he watched where the approaching lights silently moved from the clear part of the window to the fogged part, they suddenly transformed, almost spewing their aura outward in a bright halo effect. The fog combined with the escaping darkness seemed to act as a visible screen to their true essence, their souls, which was otherwise obscured.</p>

<p>The bus came to a stop. He was still looking out the fogged part of the window as his eyes focused on what looked like, incredibly, a rider on a horse approaching in the distance. He felt locked in place and unable to move his head to see if the rider would disappear when viewed through the clear part of the window. As the rider got closer his eyes shifted, and he saw another rider on a horse behind. Two riders. The wind began to howl against the side of the bus.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He sprinted, his powerful legs heaving with the strain of propelling his massive 6 foot 3 inch frame forward. His lungs sucked in as much air as they could in the short span they were allowed. They were gaining on him. Two distinct shapes in the distance. 17.2 meters &amp; closing.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As he glanced back a few moments before he could just make out their features with the ambient lighting from the houses &amp; dim street lights. Their faces were wolf like, but sinister, hideously contorted. They were howling, but only he could hear it. Long ethereal tormented howls filled his night. His v-band augmented reality display identified them as level 6 ghosts. They were there, but not really there. The two runners were also wearing v-bands, and running in another part of the world. They were chosen by v-net as competitors and spawned on his run.</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself, as to them he appeared as Astro Boy. These young kids had no originality, thinking they could psych older runners. But this was serious. If he let them gain ground he risked his level 7 standing in the league.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Show my last ghost&rsquo; he said out loud while running, seemingly to himself. His previous self spawned in front of him, running his previous run. He could see he was slacking off &amp; the two wolf like ghosts were gaining. He forced his legs to increase his pace, and sucked in more oxygen. He started gaining on his past ghost &amp; pulling away from his pursuers.</p>

<p>Suddenly his vision went black, and then it was back, but instead of the familiar scene in front of him he saw trees densely packed together. He was in a forest. The scene was moving fast, bouncing up and down, left and right. He kept running straight along the path he was on, but couldn&rsquo;t see where he was going. His v-band was showing him someone from somewhere else. What the frak was happening!</p>

<p>All this happened in seconds, so he kept running, confused, and expecting that the v-band would correct itself. The scene from his v-band lurched as if the person fell, and then was facing up looking at the trees &amp; dark sky. The vision started to darken, but before it went completely dark he saw what looked like a primitive hunter standing over him. He looked big, muscly, but with short arms, and was carrying a large spear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He was running. <em>Hard.</em> He knew instinctively to the very fibre of his being why he was running. Survival. His life. If he didn&rsquo;t run, and run fast, he was dead.</p>

<p>They were after him, howling for blood, and a more primal drive, the thrill of the hunt, and the kill. He was the prey.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>His hunters were larger than him, bigger boned, with barrel chests, shorter arms &amp; legs, but more powerful. They carried more primitive heavy stabbing spears compared to his more versatile throwing spear, which meant they needed to get close to him.</p>

<p>He knew they were getting closer. The sounds of their heavy footfalls rang through the dense forest. Their garbled grunts &amp; taunts echoed all around him, their purpose to intimidate, to frighten, but they caused the opposite reaction, it triggered his survival instinct. He ran faster.</p>

<p>Suddenly he tripped over a branch, and fell hard hitting his head on a rock. As his vision darkened, he felt like he was being thrown through something strange. And then there was total darkness. An enveloped feeling. No sound. No predators. And then, again, strangely, but differently &hellip;</p>

<p>He was running. Steadily. Consistently. Really concentrating on his breathing, his stride, the way his feet hit the ground, and his overall rhythm. He was running for fitness, competing against imagined binary ghosts, some of other souls &ndash; thousands of them scattered around the planet, but also some of himself at different places in time, but in his mind mostly against ones from the past.</p>

<p>His mind created the purpose &amp; the urgency for his running. The small computing device attached to his body was capable of storing &amp; processing massive amounts of data. While he ran it was working to pump high beats per minute music to his ears which when combined with his brain increased his heart rate &amp; blood flow.</p>

<p>The small computing device was also working to receive signals being broadcast from an array of satellites orbiting the planet, to triangulate his exact location on the planet every second. It then sent this information back into the airwaves, to be captured by a vast array of computing devices &amp; software, which then stored &amp; analysed the information, and sent back statistics &amp; insights that he could analyse, share, and interact with later.</p>

<p>He looked ahead as he ran at the scenery slowly bobbing up &amp; down, up &amp; down. He pulled more air into his lungs. This was different. Strange. Somewhat lonely, but not. He couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, but it felt good to run.</p>
