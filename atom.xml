    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 1995 (17 years ago) I created an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>
app called Demon Hacker.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s purpose was to enable a user to patch (rather crudely, but effectively)
PC games files &amp; their created saved game files to cheat.</p>

<p>I got more of a kick out of building the app using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a>, and giving it to my friends
to use than I did playing &amp; cheating in the games.</p>

<p>17 years is a <em>long</em> time in computer technology. In 1995 the Internet was emerging, and
I knew that it had been put on a few FTP sites, but could I find it now?</p>

<p>After a few minutes with Google I had found &amp; downloaded the ZIP file.
(And made sure to scan it with antivirus software).</p>

<p><em>Wow!</em></p>

<p>The problem now was that it was a 16-bit MS-DOS app.</p>

<p>With only Mac OS X Mountain Lion, and Windows 7, both 64-bit, I thought I would have
to resort to setting up a VM (Virtual Machine).</p>

<p>Another Google and I found <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox</a>.
I download &amp; opened DOSBox on Mac OS X.</p>

<p><em>Double wow!</em></p>

<p>I now had a directory listing. Look at those dates!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/dir.png"></p>

<p>Check out DEMON.EXE. That&#8217;s 29,408 bytes for the main application.
UI (User Interface).
Logic.
Everything.
That&#8217;s 29 kilobytes (KB).</p>

<p><em>Holy crap!</em></p>

<p>Next step, would it run?</p>

<p><em>BOOM!</em></p>

<p>An app that I had created 17 years ago was running in a DOS emulator on my
MAC OS X system.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run.png"></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the proof - the help screen. You have to admit, it&#8217;s very helpful :)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run-help.png"></p>

<p>It even supports in that 29 KB size changing the application font to a medieval
type font. Typical font files are MB these days.</p>

<p>The great thing about Demon Hacker is that it was open.
Extendable.
Anyone with a PC game, a HEX editor, and some spare time could create hacks
for games by editing the DEMON.DAT text file.</p>

<p>And Demon Hacker would then let anyone use that cheat.</p>

<p>If only GitHub had existed back in 1995 the source code may not have been lost.
If you&#8217;re feeling nostalgic get DOSBox, your old games, and get
<a href="http://www.github.com/peterboni/demonhacker">Demon Hacker</a>.</p>

<p>This trip back down memory lane has reminded me of a few things.
The Internet, WWW, Google &amp; technology are amazing things.
Also that i&#8217;m a hacker, and always will be.</p>
