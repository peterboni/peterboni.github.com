    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January 2013 I wanted to try something different, and decided to try running as
I had never been a runner.
In February I wrote a short story called Running, and then went on to
write a few more blog posts during the year related to <a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/categories/running/">Running</a>.</p>

<p>While I was doing all this writing, I ran a total of 529.3 kilometers,
for 53 hours, and burned 51,578 calories, which is about 25 days worth of
food for an adult (based on 2,000 calories a day).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>At the beginning of the year I could barely run 2.5 kilometers, in 6 minutes,
42 seconds per kilometer.</p>

<p>By the end of the year I had run in the City to Surf 12 kilometers (I finished in
1 hour, 14 minutes, 1 second), and finished the year strong with an arbitrary
goal &ndash; run 5 kilometers every day for 5 days.
I had also run 2.8 kilometers in 4 minutes, 39 seconds per kilometer.</p>

<p>I also lost 12.8 kilograms.</p>

<p>This year I plan to train &amp; run in the City to Surf Half Marathon, which
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=half+marathon">according to Google</a> is 21.097494 kilometers.
Very precise, thanks Google.</p>

<p>As I look back at last year it&rsquo;s the experience of running (and writing about it) that
I loved, and it&rsquo;s why I kept doing it. It&rsquo;s not about the numbers.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-07T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/12/07/a-cloud-backend-using-nodejs-on-aws</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What?! You&rsquo;re building an awesome mobile app, like this one &ndash;
<a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/29/ios-7-dynamic-type/">iOS 7 Dynamic Type</a>, and <a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/">iOS 7 UserXListView</a>,
and get to the point where you need a <em>backend</em>.
Oh no! Your complexity just increased exponentially.</p>

<p>Luckily the latest cloud computing XaaS (Everything as a service) is called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_as_a_service">BaaS</a> (Backend as a service).
BaaS offerings include <a href="https://parse.com">Parse</a> (which was acquired by Facebook earlier this year),
and the open source <a href="http://www.baasbox.com">BaasBox</a>.
The idea is that a BaaS abstracts the complexity of building a backend.</p>

<p>But is building a backend really all that difficult using cloud computing?
Let&rsquo;s find out &amp; build a cloud backend using <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>.
Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Node.js</h2>

<p>First download &amp; install <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, which is a platform for building applications in JavaScript.
It&rsquo;s powered by the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t JavaScript slow? No!</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;V8 compiles JavaScript source code directly into machine code when it is first executed.
There are no intermediate byte codes, no interpreter.&rdquo;, <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/design">https://developers.google.com/v8/design</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Node.js is fast.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to use Node.js &amp; node packages to expose web services for our awesome mobile app.</p>

<p>Why? There are lots of good articles that explain what Node.js is and what it&rsquo;s good for.
Here&rsquo;s my simple take:</p>

<ol>
<li>The web has changed from consumption (viewing web pages) to interaction (apps, social media, chat). We need better client/server technology.</li>
<li>Node.js is JavaScript on the server, which lowers the learning curve for developers.</li>
<li>Node.js has a strong open source community. NPM (Node Package Manager) is a repository
of reusable components. There are currently over 50 <em>thousand</em>, with over 3 <em>million</em> downloads per day.</li>
</ol>


<p>The goal is to build a cloud backend &ndash; expose a RESTful web API that supports OAuth 2.0, with a database.
This blog post should serve as the foundation to start you on that journey.</p>

<p>We will be using OS X Mavericks (Version 10.9), Terminal, and <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
which is available free from the App Store.</p>

<p>Create &amp; change to a new folder called <strong>cloudbackend</strong> from your Documents folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create a file called <strong>package.json</strong> and put the following JSON data object in it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express</a>, which is the
dependency you identified in the above package.json file. Express is a web
application framework. Enter &lsquo;npm install&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve just successfully built a RESTful web API with a single <em>resource</em>
called <em>test</em> which is responding to a HTTP GET method request, and is returning a
JSON data object.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s deploy our backend to the cloud.</p>

<h2>AWS</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> (Amazon Web Services) we can easily deploy our backend to the cloud while
still keeping flexibility &amp; control &ndash; things that a BaaS takes away by abstracting the complexity.</p>

<p>First sign up for the very generous <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Usage Tier</a>.
This simple tutorial should not result in charges to your account.</p>

<p>We are going to deploy <strong>cloudbackend</strong> as an Application into EB (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a>)
which is an AWS <em>Application Container</em>. The <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.concepts.architecture.html">Architectural Overview</a> shows &amp;
explains what Elastic Beanstalk is.</p>

<ol>
<li>You deploy your application to EB and it gets a unique URL &ndash; <a href="http://myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com">http://myapp.elasticbeanstalk.com</a></li>
<li>An Auto Scaling Group is created with at least 1 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> Instance (basically a VM &ndash; Virtual Machine).</li>
<li>Traffic to your application URL first goes through the ELB (Elastic Load Balancer), and then to an EC2 Instance.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once setup all AWS resources are automatically provisioned &amp; configured.
You have a fully <strong>auto load balanced, auto scaled cloud application environment</strong>.</p>

<p>Next, download &amp; install <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>

<p>Initialise your <strong>cloudbackend</strong> Git repository. Enter &lsquo;git init&rsquo;, followed by
the other commands in the following console code block.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='console'><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span> git init
</span><span class='line'><span class="go">Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/peterboni/Documents/cloudbackend/.git/</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="go">node_modules/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="go">.gitignore</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="go">EOT</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span> git add .
</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span> git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;initial app&quot;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next download &amp; extract the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/code/6752709412171743">AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Tool</a> to
your Documents folder (the cloudbackend folder should be in your Documents folder).</p>

<p>Next add the appropriate EB Python folder to your PATH.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">peters-mac-mini:cloudbackend peterboni$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you have OS X Mavericks (Version 10.9) then you already have Python 2.7.5, else you
will need to download &amp; install it.</p>

<p>Next we&rsquo;re going to create &amp; configure the <strong>cloudbackend</strong> AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Application Container. You basically enter &lsquo;eb init&rsquo; and then follow the prompts.</p>

<ol>
<li>You will need to enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which
can be found at the URL given after you enter &lsquo;eb init&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Select an AWS service region. I entered &lsquo;7&rsquo; for &lsquo;Asia Pacific (Sydney)&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Accept the default application &amp; environment names by pressing return.</li>
<li>Enter &lsquo;8&rsquo;, for &lsquo;64bit Amazon Linux 2013.09 running Node.js&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Enter &lsquo;1&rsquo;, for &lsquo;LoadBalanced&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Enter &lsquo;n&rsquo;, to skip creating an &lsquo;RDS DB Instance&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Enter &lsquo;1&rsquo;, for &lsquo;Create a default instance profile&rsquo;.</li>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/10/19/cylon-style</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received a message on May 7, 2013 that turned into a short lesson about differences, with a rather funny ending. I saved a photo of the conversation and still think about it even now.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First, some background. This person has the soul of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_(Battlestar_Galactica)">Cylon</a>. Not one of the new humanoid models, but one of the early toaster models. He&rsquo;s quietly confident and communicates with the minimum amount of words available in our language to convey meaning.</p>

<p>The incoming message simply read &lsquo;you got 10 minutes for a chat tonight ?&rsquo;. Immediately I smiled as the message was all lowercase. To me it&rsquo;s kind of like people on LinkedIn using all lowercase for their <em>name</em>. Yes, they do exist.</p>

<p>I replied asking if it could wait until tomorrow. The reply was one word, all lowercase &ndash; &lsquo;can&rsquo;. At this point I was amused enough to make fun of him. I replied &lsquo;Like I said &hellip; war-era Centurion model Cylon&rsquo;. The reply came back, once again one word, all lowercase &ndash; &lsquo;efficiency&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I thought about this for a moment. We were communicating but the replies weren&rsquo;t what I expected, i.e. a few well constructed words or sentences. I shot back &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the passion or love in efficiency?&rsquo;. The reply came and I laughed out loud &ndash; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s in there cylon style&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Touché Cylon.</p>

    <link href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/10/01/ihealth-renaissance/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-01T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/10/01/ihealth-renaissance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-10-01-ihealth-renaissance/img_1181.jpg" width="640" height="365" title="iHealth" ></p>

<p>I have experienced a personal health renaissance over the last year. My iPhone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is teaching me how to change my health, both body &amp; mind. It has offered motivation when I needed it. I believe that the iHealth Renaissance is just getting started. It could do the same for you if you let it. Let me explain how.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It all started innocently enough on January 1, 2013 when I installed the first health app on my iPhone &ndash; RunKeeper, that I had heard about from a friend. I didn&rsquo;t think I was <em>that</em> unfit as I cycled regularly, and was able to do 80km rides at a decent pace. I wanted to try something different, and decided to try running as I had never been a runner. I actually didn&rsquo;t like it as I thought that I couldn&rsquo;t do it &ndash; that I wasn&rsquo;t built for it. I&rsquo;m 189 cm (6 feet 2.4 inches), and was about 98 kg. Overweight for sure, but at the time not really concerned about it. My first run was the day after, January 2 when I ran 2.55 km at a pace of 6:42 per km, on a completely flat course.</p>

<p>RunKeeper gave me all sorts of rich feedback. Realtime audio feedback on my run. Visual statistics after my run &amp; of all previous runs. I could easily hear, see &amp; track my progress. The social networking that was built in took the feedback to the next level. Likes &amp; comments on my runs, as well as being able to view friends runs, combined with the leaderboard, gave me more motivation. I was really <a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/categories/running/">enjoying running</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t conscious of why I kept coming back &amp; using RunKeeper until I experienced a talk from <a href="http://drjasonfox.com/">Dr Jason Fox</a> (a &lsquo;motivation strategy &amp; design expert&rsquo;) at a technology conference later in the year.</p>

<blockquote><p>RunKeeper had designed running to be inherently motivating. It reduced the latency between the effort &amp; feedback. It enhanced the visibility of, and gave me a clear sense of progress. The more visible my progress, the more motivated I became. The more I ran.</p></blockquote>

<p>After RunKeeper came Strava for my cycling. I think RunKeeper supported cycling as a different activity type but I knew friends using Strava for cycling. If you were around and using the Internet in the late 90s you will remember ICQ starting the IM (Instant Messaging) wars. Some friends were on RunKeeper, and some were on Strava. I was stuck with both, which really means three apps, as Strava has two &ndash; one for cycling and one for running. All this cardio meant that weights were next. Thoughts of figuring out how to do the exercises properly again, and setting up &amp; recording scheduled routines did not motivate me at all. That&rsquo;s when a friend put me on to GymGoal 2 which managed it all for me, and gave me visual help &amp; feedback.</p>

<p>With 4 fitness apps installed &amp; being used regularly next came changing what I put into my body. My wife installed &amp; started using MyNetDiary which is essentially calorie counting, with once again, plenty of feedback that gave me a sense of progress. I could visually see how many calories I was consuming against how many I should consume to meet my target weight. What it did more than that though was teach me about what I was eating. I was shocked at a few things, for example almonds &hellip; holy crap! It hasn&rsquo;t changed what I eat, as I still enjoy beer &amp; chocolate, but it has changed my behaviour. I now think about the quality &amp; quantity of what I will put into my body.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-10-01-ihealth-renaissance/img_1137.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="Breakfast" ></p>

<p>With 5 health apps installed &amp; being used regularly I started seeing changes. 8 months of running, and 1.5 months of changing the way I eat I had dropped over 8 kg in weight, and could now comfortably run 5 km at a pace of 5:30 per km, with nice steep hills thrown in.</p>

<p>There are two more health apps that I have installed &amp; started using. The first one I came across when I read an article <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/">The Scientific 7-Minute Workout</a>. I thought that it would come in handy when I was short on time, and also as a good way to shake things up. Check out the &lsquo;7 Minute Workout &ldquo;Seven&rdquo;&rsquo; app. The last one I came across when I read a Lifehacker article <a href="http://lifehacker.com/what-happens-to-the-brain-when-you-meditate-and-how-it-1202533314">What Happens to the Brain When You Meditate (And How it Benefits You)</a>, that recommended an app created by a former Buddhist monk called <a href="http://www.getsomeheadspace.com/">Headspace</a>. Check out the app &lsquo;Headspace&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s meditation when &amp; where you have the time, which for me is on my way to work on the bus. I&rsquo;m really excited about giving meditation a go, and Headspace was built for the iHealth Renaissance.</p>

<p>I now have 7 health apps installed &amp; being used, which is the majority category of apps that I use on my iPhone. I haven&rsquo;t used a Nike+ Fuelband, Jawbone UP, or a Fitbit Flex, but I can see that the iHealth Renaissance is just starting, and that these are just early wearable accessory products.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating that I need multiple apps for the same thing, and also that I need to enter the same information into different apps. For example most of the health apps want to know my gender, age, height &amp; weight, to be able to provide me meaningful feedback. Why do I need to provide my data multiple times?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting looking at the move Apple has made with the iPhone 5s, by introducing a motion coprocessor called the M7, which continuously measures motion data &amp; makes it available for apps. I can&rsquo;t wait for the next generation of iHealth apps &amp; wearable accessory products. I think we still need wearable accessory products as apps are tucked away nicely on your iPhone. You choose when to interact with them. We need devices that we can see that constantly motivate us. Devices that further reduce the latency between effort &amp; feedback in an effortless, visual, motivational way. I think that these devices will still be accessory products that augment the core richer connected experience that can be delivered via your iPhone.</p>

<p>So the iHealth Renaissance is making good progress, but where is the iWealth Renaissance? The current batch of mobile apps from the financial services industry are primarily sales &amp; service based. Buy this product. View &amp; manage your accounts. They haven&rsquo;t started to take the next step.</p>

    <link href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/09/22/design-little-things-matter/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-22T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/09/22/design-little-things-matter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like running &amp; listening to music using my iPhone. Up until recently I was using Sennheiser In-Ear Headphones without a remote or microphone. The headphones caused me a few problems before I finally decided to buy new headphones, which made me think about design.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The first problem with my current headphones was that even though they were in-ear, they kept falling out, which was really annoying. The second problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t forward songs. Listening to a slow or uninspiring song approaching a hill is hard work. The third problem sometimes occurred with an incoming message. Fumbling to get the iPhone out of my <a href="http://www.spibelt.com.au">SPI Belt</a> &amp; read the message while running (to see if it was urgent) was difficult.</p>

<p>I did a quick review of headphones with remote &amp; microphone in the Apple Store and purchased the Sennheiser OCX 685i In-Ear Sports Headphones.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-09-22-design-little-things-matter/img_2357.jpg" width="600" height="400" title="Sennheiser OCX 685i In-Ear Sports Headphones" ></p>

<p>The ear clip design, combined with the lightweight cord &amp; clip means that they stay secure while running. No more falling out. The remote &amp; microphone work &ndash; I have full control over music. I can also use Siri to listen to incoming messages, and dictate a reply. I can even use Siri to <a href="https://twitter.com/peterboni/status/379924494527131649">Tweet</a>. The headphones are also sweat &amp; water resistant. Nearly perfect.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only problem I have with them is the <em>design</em> of the remote, which detracts from the overall experience of using the product.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compare the design of the remote on the Sennheiser in the above picture to the remote on the Apple EarPods in the below picture.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-09-22-design-little-things-matter/img_2360.jpg" width="600" height="400" title="Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic" ></p>

<p>Can you guess what the problem is? When I&rsquo;m running &amp; listening to music, I&rsquo;m watching the road ahead. I move my fingers to the remote near my neck, grab it, and feel for the controls. They&rsquo;re all placed together &amp; feel like they blend into each other. It feels like one button. This is the exact opposite experience with the Apple EarPods remote. On the Apple EarPods remote the clear indent in the middle means I feel immediately by touch the distinction between the 3 buttons, and hence how to activate the different functions that the 3 buttons enable.</p>

<p>I was reading this article today &ndash; <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-20/apple-ceo-tim-cooks-complete-interview-with-bloomberg-businessweek">Tim Cook: The Complete Interview</a>, and there are a few really good quotes from Tim Cook that I think are relevant.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We’re a product company, and so the products show the values of a company. They speak to innovation. They speak to caring about every detail. They’re a reminder of how incredibly important experience is &hellip; every detail has been thought through. The experience is an “Aha” moment.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>And then this one.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nobody worries about buttons and finishes. Nobody really worries about the experience, and we do. We’re really proud that we do.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Design is important, and only going to become more so &ndash; <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3017485/the-3-future-waves-in-design-and-how-to-ride-them">The 3 Future Waves In Design, And How To Ride Them</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has probably been millions of words written about communication. So why bother?
We communicate every day, but most of us take it for granted.
We think we know how to do it, but do we really consider the massive impact it has on
our lives? Do we actively try to get better at it?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I vividly remember my daughter around the age of 3 when learning to express
herself would suddenly blurt out &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;, or &lsquo;That makes me sad&rsquo;.
I remember feeling proud, but at the same time flustered, and sometimes annoyed
because of the timing. She was doing what my wife (an infinitely better communicator
than me) had taught her to do, to vocalise her feelings without thinking, just throw
them out there. Before she learnt to do this she used to get frustrated &amp; express
her feelings in other ways, the most common of which was crying.</p>

<p>So if expressing your feelings &amp; thoughts effectively is one part of communication the other part is what comes back to you once you do this, and what you do with it.
My daughter is 5 &frac12; now, and can engage in meaningful communication, interspersed with
periods of her imagination taking control. I notice that when I say something to her,
she will pause, and then immediately respond with a question, or less frequently an
interesting factoid that she draws out from her limited experience.
She does this with an openness that I find refreshing &amp; disarming.
Her words, tone, and body language are all aligned with a genuine interest.
There&rsquo;s not a shred of guile.</p>

<p>Of course as adults we all know how much more complex it gets. There are far more
less effective ways to communicate than in person. I wish I could convey to you how
much I dislike email &amp; it&rsquo;s seductive call, but alas, I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>

<p>I have this surreal mental movie of us all as adults. We&rsquo;re walking around in a shared existence, but within our own bubbles of reality. We have goggles strapped to our heads that we can&rsquo;t take off. These goggles are much like camera lenses that can have multiple filters stacked on. The goggles protect our eyes, but they also filter our vision. As we grow our eyes change but then so too do the goggles, as filters are added, changed, or removed. I wonder what would happen if we were to regularly pause and consider what we are, and how we communicate with those around us.</p>

<p>There has probably been millions of words written about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication">communication</a>. So why bother? Because I&rsquo;m actively trying to get better at it.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/07/25/running-memory</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Liam ran, his long muscular legs pounding the pavement. There were only a few souls out that chose to brave the cold &amp; darkness of the early morning. His breathing &amp; rhythm were steady. He wasn&rsquo;t pushing himself as he settled into his run. He ran to relax &amp; be with his thoughts.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>&ldquo;Show dad running&rdquo; he said softly to himself between breaths. Ahead of him on the long bridge his dad appeared running. He smiled to himself. The music he was listening to changed to a different track. &ldquo;Sweet Dreams, Ministry of Sound Running Trax Winter 2011&rdquo; appeared at the top of his vision, next to more text … &ldquo;Pace 5:27/km, 20sec slower/km&rdquo;. Memories of his childhood came flooding back of them running together at the park near their home, him desperately trying to keep up with his shorter legs. Better catch the old man now he thought, I&rsquo;m slacking off! He gained on his dad and was finally running in sync with him, side by side.</p>

<p>The nanotechnology in his body connected him to the vast services &amp; data available on the net and seamlessly augmented his reality, which in this case was his vision &amp; hearing. His dad had been born into a time when the world was starting to emerge from their pre-digital caves, and people started leaving digital footprints everywhere they went. He was benefiting from his dads digital footprint now. His dad loved to run, and had recorded them for his own benefit using the primitive tracking technology &amp; services of the time.</p>

<p>This was the first time Liam had been to this city. His dad had been here before &amp; run this same route. As he ran side by side with his dad, listening to the same music he had listened to many years before he felt connected to him, in a way that would not have been possible for his dad&rsquo;s generation. This was his dad, in his prime, doing something that he now loved too, and they were doing it together at different places in time.</p>

<p>As he stopped at the end of the road &amp; looked out over the water, the sight of the Sydney Opera House greeted him. They both stood there, looking at the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge to the right. He turned his head &amp; looked at the avatar of his dad, and smiled.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/07/04/ios-formatted-currency-input</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;re building an iOS app, and need the user to enter a money value. You start by using
a UITextField. If you want a basic user experience, then you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>If you want to give the user <em>something better</em>, then the pain begins. The pain is worth
it because <strong>small details matter</strong>. I&rsquo;ve taken ideas from a few places &amp; combined them
into this experience &amp; open source code.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Experience in 9 images</h2>

<p>1. We start &amp; sit there, begging the user to enter something. We&rsquo;re showing $0.00, so we have
sent a signal to them that they are entering a money value. The cursor is flashing at them
after the last 0 at the end of the formatted money value.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/1.png" width="396" height="744" title="Start, Shows $0.00" ></p>

<p>2. The user taps the 1 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $0.01</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/2.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 1, Changes to $0.01" ></p>

<p>3. The user taps the 2 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $0.12</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/3.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 2, Changes to $0.12" ></p>

<p>4. The user taps the 3 key on the number pad. The display value changes to $1.23</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t had to enter in a dot. They are just tapping numbers, and the displayed
money value is formatting itself in front of their eyes.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/4.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 3, Changes to $1.23" ></p>

<p>5. The user taps some more numbers &ndash; 4, 5, and then 6. The display value changes to $1,234.56</p>

<p>We have a comma! The money value is formatted.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/5.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap 4, 5, 6, Changes to $1,234.56" ></p>

<p>6. The user taps Delete. The display value changes to $123.45</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-07-04-ios-formatted-currency-input/6.png" width="396" height="744" title="Tap Delete, Deletes 6" ></p>

<p>7. The user moves the cursor to after 1, taps Delete. The display value changes to $23.45</p>

<p>8. From start the user gets ready to paste in &lsquo;$1,000&rsquo; (without quotes) from somewhere else.</p>

<p>9. The &lsquo;$1,000&rsquo; gets pasted in &amp; the display value changes to $1,000.00.</p>

<p>Note that the display value didn&rsquo;t change to $10.00, which would have happened if we
didn&rsquo;t trap the paste and format the value before updating the display value.</p>

<p>Also note that the user could also paste in &lsquo;1000&rsquo; or &lsquo;$1000&rsquo;.</p>

    <link href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/29/ios-7-dynamic-type/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-29T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/29/ios-7-dynamic-type</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iOS 7 introduces Dynamic Type, which if apps choose to support it, gives the user
control over text size in an app. Web pages have had this feature for free since the early
days of the web, but web browsers moved away from dynamic text sizing.
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/the-two-types-of-browser-zoom.html">The Two Types of Browser Zoom</a>.</p>

<p>iOS7 Dynamic Type automatically adjusts weight, letter spacing, and line height for every font
size. It looks <strong>stunning</strong>, but there&rsquo;s work to make your app support it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Default Size</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/">UserXListView</a> looks like with the Text Size
(Settings &ndash; General &ndash; Text Size) set to the default size in the <em>iPhone Retina (3.5-inch)</em>
iOS Simulator.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/1-text-size-normal.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Default" ></p>

<p>We get 3 &amp; &lsquo;a bit&rsquo; cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/2-userxlistview-normal.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Default" ></p>

<h2>Smallest Size</h2>

<p>Changing the Text Size to the smallest size means we can fit slightly more.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/3-text-size-small.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Smallest" ></p>

<p>Nearly 4 cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/4-userxlistview-small.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Smallest" ></p>

<h2>Largest Size</h2>

<p>Changing the Text Size to the largest size means we can fit slightly less, but get big
beautiful type.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/5-text-size-large.png" width="500" height="713" title="Text Size Largest" ></p>

<p>3 cells in the UITableView.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/6-userxlistview-large.png" width="500" height="713" title="UserXListView Largest" ></p>

<h2>Implementation, The Easy Part</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it looks, but how hard is it to make your app support it. Let&rsquo;s look at
<a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview/">UserXListView</a>. The cell layout makes use of Auto
Layout Constraints, which are very powerful.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/7-userxlistview-cell-layout.png" width="381" height="674" title="UserXListView Cell Layout" ></p>

<p>iOS 7 has defined Text Styles &ndash; Body, Caption 1, Caption 2, Footnote, Headline 1,
Headline 2, Subhead 1, and Subhead 2. We assign a Text Style to each label in the cell
layout via the attribute inspector as shown below.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-29-ios-7-dynamic-type/8-userxlistview-cell-label-attribute-inspector.png" width="316" height="196" title="UserXListView Cell Label Attribute Inspector" ></p>

<p>Once the label Text Styles &amp; Auto Layout Constraints are set, we&rsquo;re ready for the hard
part.</p>

<h2>Implementation, The Hard Part</h2>

<p>Unlike Auto Layout in this example, there&rsquo;s more work to do to support
Dynamic Type.</p>

<p>We need to make the Controller aware of a Text Size change by hooking into the
UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. iOS 7 determines &amp; applies the font attributes for each label based on the
Text Style for each label, and the iOS 7 Text Size system setting selected by the user,
and it&rsquo;s left to us (the developer) to cater for the changes in the layout to the view.</p>

<p>As you can see there&rsquo;s a bit of extra work to support Dynamic Type. It would be nice if
it was a bit smarter, a bit more automatic, but with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-24T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/24/ios-7-userxlistview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I believe the best way to understand something is to get your hands dirty, so I decided
to build the front end part of an app idea that I&rsquo;ve had for a while as an iOS 7 app.</p>

<p>While using iOS 7 for the last week or so, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the UI &amp; UX.
Of course, Metro (design language) has been around for a while thanks to Microsoft, but
the Metro apps I&rsquo;ve used feel dull. iOS 7 feels surprisingly refreshing.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One of the views in the app I&rsquo;m building needs a list of <em>things</em> that the user creates &ndash;
a typical pattern in many apps. iOS has a UITableViewController, so technically it&rsquo;s an
easy problem to solve. In terms of the design of the UI &amp; UX it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through what I call the UserXListView&trade; pattern in 7 images of the
iOS 7 app I&rsquo;ve started building.</p>

<h2>1. Empty List View</h2>

<p>Ok. We have a list view. That + in the top right corner is staring at her.
Tap me! Tap me!</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-1-list-view.png" width="396" height="744" title="1. Empty List View" ></p>

<h2>2. Add Item (with default Icon &amp; Colour)</h2>

<p>She taps +. She knows that she&rsquo;s going to create something. What&rsquo;s the first
decision? What to name it? No. The first decision is an emotional one. What&rsquo;s this thing
going to look like.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-2-add-item.png" width="396" height="744" title="2. Add Item (with default Icon & Colour)" ></p>

<p>Technically this is a modal segue; either Cancel and go back, or enter the required
information &amp; Save.</p>

<h2>3. Item Icon</h2>

<p>She taps Change Icon. This is where it gets interesting. The icons are in groups &amp; are
all black so that they are easy for her to judge equally. In this instance there&rsquo;s only one
group of simple icons from The Noun Project, that are visually related to the thing that
she is creating.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-3-icons.png" width="396" height="744" title="3. Item Icon" ></p>

<p>Once again this is a modal segue; either Cancel and go back, or give the required
information, which in this instance is selecting an icon. We use a UICollectionViewController
that&rsquo;s dynamic. We define the icon groups &amp; icons as follows.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">icons</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="nl">arrayWithObjects:</span>

</span><span class='line'>       <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>4. Item Icon Colour</h2>

<p>She taps the piggy bank icon (they&rsquo;re cute). Now she can personalise the icon even further
by selecting a colour from different groups of colour palettes. She can select a colour
from the same palette to match all her <em>things</em>, or mix &amp; match colours from different
colour palettes. The choice is hers. If she doesn&rsquo;t like the icon in any of these colours
she can either tap &lt; Icon, or as a nice feature of iOS 7, swipe left to right inside where
the icons are located and the view will slide off the top to the right and she will be taken
back to the black icons.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-4-colours.png" width="396" height="744" title="4. Item Icon Colour" ></p>

<p>This time we do a push segue. We use a UICollectionViewController that&rsquo;s dynamic, and some
Core Graphics help. In the app we only store one black piggy bank icon .png file, and at
runtime dynamically colour each piggy bank. We define the colour groups &amp; colours as follows.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="nl">arrayWithObjects:</span>
</span><span class='line'>           <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="nl">arrayWithObjects:</span><span class="s">@&quot;Winter Sunset&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#A8AB9B&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#172A38&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#EC4B5D&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#F48773&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#E0C590&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">],</span>
</span><span class='line'>           <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="nl">arrayWithObjects:</span><span class="s">@&quot;Ocean Five&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#00A0B0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#6A4A3C&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#CC333F&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#EB6841&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">@&quot;#EDC951&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">],</span>
</span><span class='line'>       <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then do some magic with the black piggy bank icon with a helper.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>5. Add Item (with selected Icon &amp; Colour)</h2>

<p>She taps the red piggy bank in the Ocean Five colour group, and is taken back to the
2. Add Item view, with her red piggy bank there waiting for her. She can now enter the
other information and tap Save.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-5-add-item.png" width="396" height="744" title="5. Add Item (with selected Icon & Colour)" ></p>

<h2>6. Item in List View</h2>

<p>She taps Save, and her new red piggy bank is waiting for her in the list view. All that&rsquo;s
left to do is to add some more.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-6-list-view.png" width="396" height="744" title="6. Item in List View" ></p>

<h2>7. List View with Items</h2>

<p>As she looks at the list of her <em>things</em>, she instantly recognises &amp; associates with each
one, as it has her personal identifying touch.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-06-24-ios-7-userxlistview/app-7-list-view-lots.png" width="396" height="744" title="7. List View with Items" ></p>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s easy to give the user power over their <em>things</em> by a simple mobile
UI &amp; UX pattern, hereby called the UserXListView&trade; pattern.</p>

<h2>Storyboard</h2>

<p>For reference here&rsquo;s how the views hang together in the Storyboard. Excluding the
UINavigationControlers we have a UITableViewController, UIViewController, and
two UICollectionViewControllers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He sat on the bus in the pre-dawn light. Fog partially covered the windows. The inside of the bus felt enclosed in a safe bubble type of way with other silent, faceless souls, the backs of their heads illuminated by the smartphones their heads were buried in.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The brief hint of a smile, or maybe sadness touched his face as he thought of the irony, people connected to the world, but isolated from others in their own bubbles. Lights flashed past the windows as the bus ambled along.</p>

<p>As if in a dream, he slowly turned his head and looked out the window. In awe, he watched where the approaching lights silently moved from the clear part of the window to the fogged part, they suddenly transformed, almost spewing their aura outward in a bright halo effect. The fog combined with the escaping darkness seemed to act as a visible screen to their true essence, their souls, which was otherwise obscured.</p>

<p>The bus came to a stop. He was still looking out the fogged part of the window as his eyes focused on what looked like, incredibly, a rider on a horse approaching in the distance. He felt locked in place and unable to move his head to see if the rider would disappear when viewed through the clear part of the window. As the rider got closer his eyes shifted, and he saw another rider on a horse behind. Two riders. The wind began to howl against the side of the bus.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-01T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/06/01/people-based-working</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some companies have traditional work environments. When you come into work, you have an assigned desk. You are physically located with your team, which is located within that teams larger team, and so on. The company feels like it physically revolves around you. You are physically partitioned &amp; packed into a master seating plan, maintained &amp; controlled by The Collective of Master Seating Plan Controllers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious &amp; defined order to it all. You know where you sit. You know your place, because its there, day after day. It doesn&rsquo;t move, even though your work &amp; the people who you work with does. You are the master of your own domain. It contains your stuff, your possessions. It has your personal touch. Outside battles &amp; war rage, but inside your domain its peaceful. You have focus because of consistency.</p>

<p>Some companies have non traditional work environments. One style is ABW &ndash; Activity Based Working. When you come into work, you don&rsquo;t have an assigned desk. You have a locker like you did in school that contains your work tools &amp; minimal possessions. Your first task for the day is to find a desk. This is more complicated than it sounds. What time did you get in? What activity are you doing today?</p>

<p>Teams migrate in packs. One lone wolf can disrupt the established base of a team, and set them on a random migration path, which in turn has a ripple effect in the office ecosystem across a floor, and into other floors. Overt (mostly silent) psychological wars are fought over areas by teams posturing, and positioning of physical objects like whiteboards, agile card walls, posters, or pictures. Some teams are firmly entrenched, and won&rsquo;t be moved, even by the occasional interloper.</p>

<p>Once you select a desk, if you don&rsquo;t immediately clean it, you&rsquo;re touching potentially multiple people&rsquo;s germs all over the desk, keyboard, mouse &amp; phone, and then yourself &ndash; your face, your food, and other people. This all takes time that&rsquo;s not spent working, which can be frustrating. Sometimes you think &ldquo;I sat here yesterday. Maybe I don&rsquo;t need to clean everything today.&rdquo; As you sit there in this foreign, sparse, sterile, non personal environment, the people around you may or may not be different from yesterday. It depends what the people who come in after you do. Where will they go when they come in? What complex logic (or not for that matter) will they follow to select their desk?</p>

<p>The environment is mostly not peaceful, or conducive to solitary productive thinking work. There&rsquo;s more noise. People are more chatty. It&rsquo;s harder to concentrate for lengthy periods at a time, even in so called designated quiet work styled areas. It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>

<p>To an outsider ABW may appear as chaos. But to an insider, strange things happen in ABW. You can sit next to people you are working with &amp; collaborate with them more effectively. You can sit next to different people. You can move if you don&rsquo;t want to sit next to someone. You can have random conversations that may, or may not prove immediately useful. The amazing thing is that you can do these things every day.</p>

<p>If you want to move to your activity there is no lengthy process through The Collective of Master Seating Plan Controllers. You just &hellip; move. You feel like you are part of something bigger than just your small team. You feel more empowered. You seem to physically revolve around the company with people, and the company &amp; the people feel like the core purpose of why you are there.</p>

<p>You learn to live with the noise, the constant interruptions, and not owning a space. The space serves a purpose, not just you. You begin to see patterns of movement &amp; highly productive collaboration. You start to participate &amp; change your style of working. You begin to think that you can&rsquo;t go back to a traditional work environment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently took a month leave from work &amp; did absolutely nothing. Well not nothing. I did something I&rsquo;ve never done before. I didn&rsquo;t do any work. I spent it with my family. I relaxed. Really relaxed. I disconnected from my life of work, more work, the Internet, computers &amp; technology. Well, ok, mostly for the last few. This may not seem momentous to you, but for me it was.</p>

<p>The last major break I had was when my son Liam was born. My idea then of relaxing in between all the crying and sleepless nights was to learn the Android platform by creating an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.bankwest.mobile&amp;hl=en">App</a>. The App was released August 2011. Now with an average rating of 3.8 out of 5 and over 80,000 installs it has been successful, even if I wasn&rsquo;t successful at relaxing.</p>

<p>When I returned to work I felt strange. The first few days I was wondering why I was there. What was I doing. What was my purpose. Why did I come here (other than the obvious reasons). I&rsquo;d look out the window and feel in my soul that I needed to return to the existence I had come from. I missed my pain in the butt kids. There was the usual jokes with family and friends. &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s reality? Happy to be back at work? ;)&rdquo;, to which I replied jokingly &ldquo;Reality sucks!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What I started to notice in the first few days was that I was relaxed at my core. I could think before speaking &amp; putting words out there, making sure they were positive and added value. It sharpened my focus. I no longer felt like a speeding train. I felt like I&rsquo;d slowed down inside, and was more effective for it.</p>

<p>A few more days passed, and it was the end of the first week. The feeling of strangeness was still there, but so too was the feeling of being relaxed at my core. I resolved to fight like hell to keep it. I started to change my habits. I made time for breakfast in the morning. I resolved not to rush. I made time for exercise; riding, running, walking &amp; started weights again after many years. I made time for my family. I made time for meditation. I&rsquo;ve made time for thinking, writing &amp; doing. There&rsquo;s only so many hours in a day, so I stopped doing things that didn&rsquo;t add value, and just added noise to my life. It&rsquo;s a liberating feeling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s affected me in other ways too. I had one of my best runs in my first week back at work. Relaxed. Smooth. Good pace &amp; rhythm. But still competitive. I still increased my pace, clawing at the road, gasping for breath for the last couple hundred metres. A neighbour would have seen this person run up the road, collapse on the lawn, gasping for breath, scrambling at his iPhone to press finish on Strava. As I lay there on the lawn, the beats from the earbuds combining with the pounding of my ears, sweat pouring off my face and down my neck, the wind hitting me, I felt alive. I felt great. It&rsquo;s reflected in my edited Strava Name for the run &ndash; &ldquo;BOOM FEEL MY RYTHM STICK BOUNCE !&rdquo;.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/04/03/app-dev-is-not-rapid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Application Development is not Rapid. There, I finally typed it. It feels like a weight off my fingers. I have been creating applications for over 20 years, and do a damn good job of it. I&rsquo;m not arrogant, there are many developers that are smarter, more creative, or more productive. If I was to describe myself as a developer in one word I&rsquo;d say simple, which is kind of funny, because fear of being labelled that has stopped me writing this in the past. This is a post based on my thoughts &amp; feelings at the state of application development.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I have written before about why I <a href="http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/02/24/creating-software/">create software</a>, and my struggle with software development complexity. I&rsquo;m going to tell a story about my experience with the Technology, and it&rsquo;s contribution to the People, Process &amp; Technology triad when building applications.</p>

<p>My first job out of university was doing Microsoft Access &lsquo;database&rsquo; development for a large mining company. I put database in quotes because I didn&rsquo;t think of Access as strictly a database at the time. We built tables with constraints &amp; relationships, queries, forms, reports, and logic (macros &amp; VBA). Mostly via point &amp; click, and writing simple code. We built applications. It was and still is amazing to me how much two Access developers built, with one of them being so naive &amp; inexperienced.</p>

<p>I then progressed to building a web application, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ColdFusion (version 4.0 from 1999) &amp; SQL Server. There&rsquo;s a few more technologies there than my Microsoft Access experience, but ColdFusion rocked. It joined the other technologies together seamlessly, and it made creating an application rapid. I felt productive.</p>

<blockquote><p>To me rapid development meant quickly building working application software that fulfilled a need with simple, powerful tools. It meant building &amp; joining together the parts in an easily learned, understood, and consistent way that supported change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where did I find myself after a few experiences of rapid application development? I found myself in the distinctly non-rapid world of enterprise systems development. There was titanic Sun, IBM, Oracle &amp; Microsoft technologies. I found myself submerged in Sun Java, J2SE, J2EE, IBM WebSphere, Oracle Database, and Microsoft .NET &amp; Servers. Within each one I used a dizzying array of technologies &ndash; to use an abstract term to describe the things you could use &amp; the ways you could use them. There were plenty of acronyms that made you feel accomplished if you knew what they stood for, even if you didn&rsquo;t know what they did.</p>

<p>My view of web application architecture had exploded from a few technologies to many, many layers of them. ColdFusion was replaced by an astoundingly complex maze of choices. Want to display a database field on the screen? Oh, not so quick Mr Simple Developer. We need to do it in a modern, best practice, scalable way. I did not feel productive.</p>

<p>This is where some people would stop me in my story, call me a non-believer, and then begin to preach the virtues of their given religion. I have no desire to go into any of them here. All I will say is that I&rsquo;ve seen people wield them as weapons, instead of collaborating with people to use them. The criteria I evaluate technology by is pretty simple. Can I understand it? Does it make sense in my gut? This may seem like a simpletons view, but it&rsquo;s proven correct time &amp; again. Is it simple to understand &amp; work with quickly? How many layers of abstraction or indirection are there? What value do they add? Is there a simpler way to do it? Would other people understand what it&rsquo;s doing? How about in 5 years? Is it closed, open, popular? What does it feel like to use?</p>

<p>Microsoft Access &amp; ColdFusion still exist 13 years after I used them. Access 2013 looks like it&rsquo;s been given new Metro (sorry, Windows 8-style UI) &amp; web coats, but underneath it looks like the same animal that has not evolved in over a decade. There are rapid application development platforms &amp; tools out there, but why haven&rsquo;t they evolved, and become more widely used for application development? particularly enterprise systems development?</p>

    <updated>2013-03-09T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/03/09/glitch-in-the-matrix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He sprinted, his powerful legs heaving with the strain of propelling his massive 6 foot 3 inch frame forward. His lungs sucked in as much air as they could in the short span they were allowed. They were gaining on him. Two distinct shapes in the distance. 17.2 meters &amp; closing.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As he glanced back a few moments before he could just make out their features with the ambient lighting from the houses &amp; dim street lights. Their faces were wolf like, but sinister, hideously contorted. They were howling, but only he could hear it. Long ethereal tormented howls filled his night. His v-band augmented reality display identified them as level 6 ghosts. They were there, but not really there. The two runners were also wearing v-bands, and running in another part of the world. They were chosen by v-net as competitors and spawned on his run.</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself, as to them he appeared as Astro Boy. These young kids had no originality, thinking they could psych older runners. But this was serious. If he let them gain ground he risked his level 7 standing in the league.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Show my last ghost&rsquo; he said out loud while running, seemingly to himself. His previous self spawned in front of him, running his previous run. He could see he was slacking off &amp; the two wolf like ghosts were gaining. He forced his legs to increase his pace, and sucked in more oxygen. He started gaining on his past ghost &amp; pulling away from his pursuers.</p>

<p>Suddenly his vision went black, and then it was back, but instead of the familiar scene in front of him he saw trees densely packed together. He was in a forest. The scene was moving fast, bouncing up and down, left and right. He kept running straight along the path he was on, but couldn&rsquo;t see where he was going. His v-band was showing him someone from somewhere else. What the frak was happening!</p>

<p>All this happened in seconds, so he kept running, confused, and expecting that the v-band would correct itself. The scene from his v-band lurched as if the person fell, and then was facing up looking at the trees &amp; dark sky. The vision started to darken, but before it went completely dark he saw what looked like a primitive hunter standing over him. He looked big, muscly, but with short arms, and was carrying a large spear.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/02/24/creating-software</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi my name is Peter and I&rsquo;m a developer, now playing an architect, and still trying to figure out what that means. But that&rsquo;s a post for another day. Probably many posts.</p>

<p>To put this post in context my background is mostly &lsquo;front end&rsquo; software development in DOS, Windows, Web, and Mobile; mostly with software that has a user interface, but occasionally not.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Complexity</h2>

<p>I have always struggled with software development complexity.</p>

<p>I love software development. Communicating &amp; collaborating with people and computers, thinking, planning, modelling, designing, delving into my creative mind &amp; soul, engineering and <em>crafting</em> software that fulfils a need, creating is … awesome!</p>

<p>Software development is complex, but I believe <em>we make it more complex</em>. In our quest to make software development better, we lose focus, and we end up creating complexity.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Complexity can exist at many different steps in the software development journey. What do you do with something that&rsquo;s complex? You create a process to perform it of course.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most infamous process is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The waterfall model is a sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds great doesn&rsquo;t it? Follow a detailed plan, err &hellip; &lsquo;phases in a waterfall&rsquo;, and you will have software at the end of the process that fulfils your need. People have been following it for <em>decades</em>. There&rsquo;s only one problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The first formal description of the waterfall model is often cited as a 1970 article by Winston W. Royce, although Royce did not use the term &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; in this article. Royce presented this model as an example of a flawed, non-working model.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>But this didn&rsquo;t stop people from using it. <em>Still hasn&rsquo;t.</em> Perhaps there is perceived safety in process. If you follow instructions, surely you will achieve the desired end result?</p>

<p>On my first agile project we delivered a green fields software system in 8 months, which would have taken <em>years</em> using our traditional software development process, and this included learning an agile process, tools &amp; techniques. After the project ended I returned to one of the traditional software development areas. Two things struck me like physical blows, and left me with a feeling of complete loss &amp; bewilderment.</p>

<p>The first was that email was my process again. I sent more emails in that first day than in the previous 8 months. The second thing was when I was sitting in my little cubicle, nicely partitioned, I overheard a conversation between two developers &ndash; &ldquo;Reject defect #537. That&rsquo;s not a defect because&hellip;&rdquo; I forget the specifics, but remember that it was two developers, an absurd defect number, and they literally talked about it for 10 &ndash; 15 minutes. It never occurred to them that they should go find the tester &amp; <em>talk</em> to them.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>Processes can be complex, and so can the dizzying universe of technology which is created &amp; wielded by people.</p>

<p>Programming languages are used to build software, and there are thousands of them, with more being created every year. Each one has it&rsquo;s own syntax (form) and semantics (meaning) for expressing it&rsquo;s instructions to a machine.</p>

<p>There are different types of software. For example operating systems manage hardware and provide services for other software. Platforms, frameworks, libraries, and applications use operating systems, and each other.</p>

<p>Each piece of software can be complex, and working software can be a complex web of relationships between them. Just how complex can be highlighted by a seemingly absurd comparison.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For decades computer scientists have strived to build machines that can calculate faster than the human brain and store more information. The contraptions have won. &hellip; Biology does a lot with a little: the human genome, which grows our body and directs us through years of complex life, requires less data than a laptop operating system.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mark Fischetti, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=computers-vs-brains">Computers versus Brains</a><br/>
Scientific American, November, 2011</p></blockquote>

<p>It takes time to understand technology, when to use it, and how to apply it, and people often come away with different understanding, and a different level of skill in using it.</p>

<p>Early in my career I was working on a project when it was decided a well known services company (name withheld) would come in, save the day, and show us how to do it properly. There was one <em>recognised expert</em> I will always remember. He sat quietly aloof at his desk every day, apart from the occasional very important closed door meeting. Each day he would take from his desk a book from the vast array of &lsquo;software development&rsquo; books on it (his personal collection), sit there with it in front of his computer and implement some new form of <em>best practice</em> code or <em>pattern</em> for the part of the project he was working on. He was seen as highly productive.</p>

<p>When he left his masterpiece was given to me, with no hand over. You can guess the outcome. It was either the most brilliant code I have ever seen in my entire life, and I was unworthy to begin to comprehend it&rsquo;s magnificence, or it was a pile of shit. The truth was probably somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>The sad thing is I&rsquo;ve seen this behaviour to varying degrees <em>consistently</em> over the years. It&rsquo;s something I have been guilty of as well. People wielding technology, rather than collaborating with people using technology.</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>When I think about software development I think about the following words in a positive, <em>great</em> context.</p>

<p>People.<br/>
Purpose.<br/>
Knowledge.<br/>
Capability.<br/>
Humility.<br/>
Communication.<br/>
Collaboration.<br/>
Compromise.<br/>
Consistency.<br/>
Passion.<br/>
Time.<br/>
Technology.<br/>
Simplicity.</p>

<p>I put people first. They are the enduring <em>thread</em> that ties man to machine, and getting it to do what they want. Process &amp; Technology seem to forget that sometimes.</p>

<p>I put technology second last. Without everything before it, it is useless.</p>

<p>I put simplicity last. I believe it will <em>emerge</em> if you have the rest.</p>

<p>If only we had all of these things, all of the time.</p>

<p>You can create software without some of these things, but not <em>great</em> software.</p>

    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/02/15/running</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>He was running. <em>Hard.</em> He knew instinctively to the very fibre of his being why he was running. Survival. His life. If he didn&rsquo;t run, and run fast, he was dead.</p>

<p>They were after him, howling for blood, and a more primal drive, the thrill of the hunt, and the kill. He was the prey.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>His hunters were larger than him, bigger boned, with barrel chests, shorter arms &amp; legs, but more powerful. They carried more primitive heavy stabbing spears compared to his more versatile throwing spear, which meant they needed to get close to him.</p>

<p>He knew they were getting closer. The sounds of their heavy footfalls rang through the dense forest. Their garbled grunts &amp; taunts echoed all around him, their purpose to intimidate, to frighten, but they caused the opposite reaction, it triggered his survival instinct. He ran faster.</p>

<p>Suddenly he tripped over a branch, and fell hard hitting his head on a rock. As his vision darkened, he felt like he was being thrown through something strange. And then there was total darkness. An enveloped feeling. No sound. No predators. And then, again, strangely, but differently &hellip;</p>

<p>He was running. Steadily. Consistently. Really concentrating on his breathing, his stride, the way his feet hit the ground, and his overall rhythm. He was running for fitness, competing against imagined binary ghosts, some of other souls &ndash; thousands of them scattered around the planet, but also some of himself at different places in time, but in his mind mostly against ones from the past.</p>

<p>His mind created the purpose &amp; the urgency for his running. The small computing device attached to his body was capable of storing &amp; processing massive amounts of data. While he ran it was working to pump high beats per minute music to his ears which when combined with his brain increased his heart rate &amp; blood flow.</p>

<p>The small computing device was also working to receive signals being broadcast from an array of satellites orbiting the planet, to triangulate his exact location on the planet every second. It then sent this information back into the airwaves, to be captured by a vast array of computing devices &amp; software, which then stored &amp; analysed the information, and sent back statistics &amp; insights that he could analyse, share, and interact with later.</p>

<p>He looked ahead as he ran at the scenery slowly bobbing up &amp; down, up &amp; down. He pulled more air into his lungs. This was different. Strange. Somewhat lonely, but not. He couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, but it felt good to run.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-01T07:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.peterboni.net/blog/2013/01/01/failmeaningfully</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was August 2010. Over 2 years ago. My beautiful daughter Abigail was 2 years old. The iPhone 4 had just come out, and the smartphone revolution was in full swing. All I needed was an idea. Somehow I found myself become part of a like minded, passionate &amp; committed team, with some of the best people I have ever had the privilege or pleasure to work with. I say somehow because I&rsquo;ve always tried to go with the flow. It just happened. Redistore was born.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox center" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/website.png" width="569" height="635" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<!--more-->


<p>The idea &amp; vision was simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if you could order &amp; pay for your coffee <em>before</em> you arrived at the store, just waltz in, bypass the queue, pick it up &amp; go. It&rsquo;s paid for so there&rsquo;s no fumbling around for change, or paying with a card which was time consuming before contactless payment, e.g. MasterCard PayPass. I thought the idea had potential. The team thought the idea had potential. People we talked to thought the idea had potential. We decided as a team to take a risk. &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams">If you build it, he will come</a>&rsquo;, we all heard the voice whisper. Others were skeptical, but not us. We built it.</p>

<p>2 years later, and Redistore has failed. This is what I learnt.</p>

<h2>Reality</h2>

<p>I can still remember how it started. The excitement of exploring the idea. Formulating it. Talking about it. Becoming a team. It felt awesome. That&rsquo;s the Hollywood beginning.</p>

<p>The reality was a hard slog of trying to work two jobs. 15 to 16 hour days, 5 to 6 days a week. Rise at 6am, cycle to work &amp; be working by 7am. Leave at 4pm. Be home &amp; sorted by 5pm. Two hours to spend with my family, which I&rsquo;m guilty of not doing enough of. At work by 7pm. Work till 9pm or 10pm. Rinse &amp; repeat. And don&rsquo;t forget the weekends. You get the picture. I had no life.</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>

<p><em>But</em> we built something that&rsquo;s bloody cool &amp; has possibility. A fully customisable, real time online ordering system for low value, high volume consumables. Coffee stores. Take away food. The order is paid for by the customer using their Redistore account which they can &lsquo;top up&rsquo; using PayPal or a Credit Card. The store gets a verified order. It&rsquo;s in real time. There&rsquo;s no queueing. Win win.</p>

<p>The technology &amp; platform that we built was the fun part.</p>

<p>The customer web client was built using Sencha ExtJS 3 and supports all major browsers. It was designed &amp; built from scratch to provide a <em>fast</em> UX (User Experience) for browsing stores &amp; ordering, unlike most classic page request &amp; response web stores. ExtJS is an amazing platform, but has a steep learning curve, and ExtJS 4 broke compatibility for ExtJS 3 apps; there is significant work required to upgrade your app.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient1.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient2.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/webclient3.png" width="795" height="600" title="Redistore Web Site" ></p>

<p>The now defunct customer mobile client was built using Sencha Touch 1. The native vs. web app mobile holy war was raging, and we decided to build a web app. It was a mistake. The mobile client worked adequately on iOS, but on Android it was unusable. The tools were not ready. Facebook had not yet <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">admitted their mistake</a>, nor Sencha fired their <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story/">Fastbook</a> return. We needed a <em>great</em> customer UX, and didn&rsquo;t have it.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox left" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2013-01-01-failmeaningfully/iphone-app.png" width="320" height="548" title="Redistore iPhone App" ></p>

<p>The store receiver client was also built with Sencha Touch, and performs adequately for stores on an iPod.</p>

<p>The web clients communicate via Ajax to the back end action style JSON based web services developed using .NET WCF. If building using the same core technology now, we&rsquo;d seriously look at Web API &amp; RESTful services. There&rsquo;s also a ton of awesome back-end enterprise system type stuff (database, reconciliation, reporting, MI etc.), that was built by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_(Battlestar_Galactica)">Cylon</a>. Seriously. They work <em>hard</em>, I guess because they don&rsquo;t need to sleep.</p>

<p>To address the <em>great</em> customer mobile UX, after go-live we spent 3 months building a native iPhone app, and 3 months building a native Android app. It was a great learning experience at the cost of 6 months of effort. Without getting into details of our approach, or religious debates, I hope that we (the industry) can move <strong>forward</strong> to <em>the web</em>. How we do that is for <a href="http://www.okito.net/post/38255553240/the-mobile-web">smart people</a> to <a href="http://lilly.tumblr.com/post/38309067913/asymmetry">work out</a>.</p>

<h2>Go Live</h2>

<p>We went live on Friday 1st April 2011 (oh the irony) after 8 months of intense development. There were teething problems as with any new production system, and we worked through them to get it to a stable state.</p>

<p>We tried to sell it mostly to coffee stores the old fashioned way, by approaching them, talking to them about it, showing them what it could do. Once we had a store on board we did really simple customer advertising at the store.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s <em>far</em> from being a runaway success, it has &amp; continues to be <em>successful</em>, in that it ticks along &amp; is used every single business day, with no issues.</p>

<p>Over 18 months in production, what are the stats?</p>

<ul>
<li>250 accounts. 43 active in November 2012. 68 with a balance > $5.</li>
<li>5 stores. 2 active.</li>
<li>4,712 orders (multiple items per order). 63% using web. 36% using mobile.</li>
<li>1,900 top ups (min $5 per top up).</li>
</ul>


<p>The order percentages between web &amp; mobile are interesting. The 2 active stores are located in office buildings, and it implies customers prefer using the web client to order from their desks, before going down to pickup their order.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>The enthusiasm &amp; commitment for the idea &amp; vision has dispersed. What it could have been didn&rsquo;t materialise, and not by lack of effort.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we really understood our customer, as we really just replaced phone orders. We didn&rsquo;t have an automated store onboarding process, so bringing stores on was a long complicated process. We didn&rsquo;t do marketing.</p>

<p>We took a gamble, and it didn&rsquo;t pay off. We failed.</p>

<h2>End</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to move on. To take what I&rsquo;ve learnt &amp; move forward. I&rsquo;m excited about seeking new ideas &amp; projects. Exploring. Finding. Trying. I love the process of creating things. I&rsquo;ve heard the expression &lsquo;<strong>fail fast</strong>&rsquo;, but I think you should &lsquo;<strong>fail meaningfully</strong>&rsquo; at something you choose, have <a href="http://www.zurb.com/article/1131/passion-to-fail-fast">passion</a>
 for, believe in, and work hard at. Learning takes quality time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to move on … <em>after</em> I finish reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com">The Lean Startup</a> by Eric Ries.</p>

<h2>Update: September 22, 2013</h2>

<p>PayPal released their updated app for iOS, version 5.0.1 on <strong>September 5, 2013</strong>.
It&rsquo;s shown below next to Redistore for iOS, which introduced store distance features in version 1.3 released on <strong>April 23, 2012</strong>. Looks like there is some similarity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 1995 (17 years ago) I created an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>
app called Demon Hacker.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s purpose was to enable a user to patch (rather crudely, but effectively)
PC games files &amp; their created saved game files to cheat.</p>

<p>I got more of a kick out of building the app using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a>, and giving it to my friends
to use than I did playing &amp; cheating in the games.</p>

<p>17 years is a <em>long</em> time in computer technology. In 1995 the Internet was emerging, and
I knew that it had been put on a few FTP sites, but could I find it now?</p>

<p>After a few minutes with Google I had found &amp; downloaded the ZIP file.
(And made sure to scan it with antivirus software).</p>

<p><em>Wow!</em></p>

<p>The problem now was that it was a 16-bit MS-DOS app.</p>

<p>With only Mac OS X Mountain Lion, and Windows 7, both 64-bit, I thought I would have
to resort to setting up a VM (Virtual Machine).</p>

<p>Another Google and I found <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">DOSBox</a>.
I download &amp; opened DOSBox on Mac OS X.</p>

<p><em>Double wow!</em></p>

<p>I now had a directory listing. Look at those dates!</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/dir.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>Check out DEMON.EXE. That&rsquo;s 29,408 bytes for the main application.
UI (User Interface).
Logic.
Everything.
That&rsquo;s 29 kilobytes (KB).</p>

<p><em>Holy crap!</em></p>

<p>Next step, would it run?</p>

<p><em>BOOM!</em></p>

<p>An app that I had created 17 years ago was running in a DOS emulator on my
MAC OS X system.</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the proof &ndash; the help screen. You have to admit, it&rsquo;s very helpful :)</p>

<p><img class="fancybox" src="http://www.peterboni.net/media/images/2012-09-01-demon-hacker/run-help.png" title="Demon Hacker" ></p>

<p>It even supports in that 29 KB size changing the application font to a medieval
type font. Typical font files are MB these days.</p>

<p>The great thing about Demon Hacker is that it was open.
Extendable.
Anyone with a PC game, a HEX editor, and some spare time could create hacks
for games by editing the DEMON.DAT text file.</p>

<p>And Demon Hacker would then let anyone use that cheat.</p>

<p>If only GitHub had existed back in 1995 the source code may not have been lost.
If you&rsquo;re feeling nostalgic get DOSBox, your old games, and get
<a href="http://www.github.com/peterboni/demonhacker">Demon Hacker</a>.</p>

<p>This trip back down memory lane has reminded me of a few things.
The Internet, WWW, Google &amp; technology are amazing things.
Also that i&rsquo;m a hacker, and always will be.</p>
